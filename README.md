# Reacher

From your local machine, ReacherDocker will,

+ build a docker image on the remote (docker must already be installed and ssh enabled) according to specifications
+ set up container on the remote with port port-forwarding and enviroment variables 
+ execute your local code on the remote, in the container, with printouts shown as your were running it locally
+ upload/download files from the container to your local machine

and for your local machine, Reacher will,

+ execute your local code on the remote, with printouts shown as your were running it locally
+ upload/download files from the remote to your local machine

# Getting started...

To get started,

```bash
pip install reacher
pip install python-dotenv
```

First we must setup a connection to the remote, RemoteClient will create a ssh connection between the local and remote machine.

```python
from reacher.reacher import Reacher, ReacherDocker, RemoteClient
from dotenv import dotenv_values
config = dotenv_values()  # take environment variables from .env.
client = RemoteClient(
    host=config["HOST"],
    user=config["USER"],
    password=config["PASSWORD"],
    ssh_key_filepath=config["SSH_KEY_PATH"]
)
```

the connection is sent to ReacherDocker together with the name of the image that we want to build and the name of the container.

```python
reacher = ReacherDocker(
    client=client,
    build_name="base",
    image_name="base",
    build_context="dockercontext",
)
```

or send in the aruments for RemoteClient direcly to Reacher

```python
reacher = ReacherDocker(
    client=client,
    build_name="base",
    image_name="base",
    build_context="dockercontext",
    host=config["HOST"],
    user=config["USER"],
    password=config["PASSWORD"],
    ssh_key_filepath=config["SSH_KEY_PATH"]
)
```

build_context should contain everything for building the docker image on the remote. It might look like,

```bash
$ ls dockercontext/
Dockerfile  requirements.txt
```

Once ReacherDocker has been setup we can build the image on the remote. ReacherDocker will send the build_context to the remote and
trigger docker to build an image according to the specifications in the Dockerfile

```python
reacher.build()

[+] Building 0.0s (0/1)                                                         
[+] Building 0.2s (2/3)                                                         
 => [internal] load .dockerignore                                          0.0s
 => => transferring context: 2B                                            0.0s
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile                       0.0s
 => => transferring dockerfile: 528B                                       0.0
 ...
 ...
```

and thereafter we can setup the docker container. Reacher will make sure this container is running until we have explicitly deleted it.

```python
reacher.setup(ports=[8888, 6666], envs=dotenv_values(".env"))
```

If you want to execute the code direcly on the remote, not in a container, go for Reacher. Reacher will use the remote enviroment, as is, when executing the commands.

```python
reacher = Reacher(
    build_name="base",
    host=config["HOST"],
    user=config["USER"],
    password=config["PASSWORD"],
    ssh_key_filepath=config["SSH_KEY_PATH"],
    prefix_cmd="PATH=...."
)
```

```prefix_cmd``` is useful to set when we want to specify some PATH or when we want to source an venv before running a command. 

# Port-forwarding between remote and local

If you want to access some service on the remote, you can forward the traffic on the ports of the remote to the local machine.

```python
reacher.add_port_forward(remote_port=6006, local_port=5998, paramiko=True)
```

this will spin of a seperate daemon thread handling the port-forwading. Set paramiko to False to trigger a system call for the port forwarding instead.


# Put and getting files

Supports list of files or single files

```python
reacher.put(["setup.py", "build.sh", "reacher"], <destination>)
```

default destination is root directory of the build.

```python
reacher.get(["setup.py", "build.sh", "reacher"], <destination>)
```

default destination is ```.reacher/build_name```, relative your local path.

Use ```reacher.ls(base_path)``` to list files on the remote.

# Running commands on the remote 

```python
reacher.execute_command("ls", wrap_in_screen=True, named_session="test")
```

wrap the command in a screen if running something that you want make persistent. If named_session is not specified an unique id will be created for the sesssion.
```reacher.list_named_sessions()``` will list current sessions and ```reacher.kill_named_sessions(<session_name>)``` will kill the selected session.

# Running code on the remote 

## Running a code-snippet 

Now we have built the docker image on the remote and have a container ready to execute whatever code that we want to run.

A "Hello World" test can be triggered from a notebook.

First we create the python module that we want to execute,


```python
%%writefile simple_test.py
import time
while 1:
    print("Hello from remote")
    time.sleep(1)
```

and then we execute it on the remote inside our controlled docker enviroment.

```python
reacher.execute(
    command="python simple_test.py",
    context=["simple_test.py"],
    named_session="simple_test",
    # clean the container from previous runs.
    cleanup_before=True, 
    wrap_in_screen=True,
)

Hello from remote
Hello from remote
...
```

simple_test will continue to run in the background (even if you kill the cell/script that you instantiated the reacher.execute from) until we explicitly have killed it.

With list_named_sessions you can get all currently running sessions.

```python
reacher.list_named_sessions()
There is a screen on:
	22.simple_test	(03/19/23 18:20:07)	(Attached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-root.
```
we can always attach to a named session to continue to get printouts.

```python
reacher.attach_named_session("simple_test")
```

or kill it

```python
reacher.kill_named_session("simple_test")
```

## Running with dependencies 

To execute some code that depends on other modules inside a src directory, simply add src as a context_folder when calling 
reacher.execute.

```python
%%writefile dependency_test.py
from dependency import Dependency
d = Dependency()
```

```python
reacher.execute(
    command="python dependency_test.py",
    context=["src", "dependency_test.py"],
    named_session="dependency_test",
)

Hello from class Dependency
[screen is terminating]
```
